NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCopyright - Insert copyright statement into
    source code files

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

        [InsertCopyright]

    In your source files (before "__END__"):

      # COPYRIGHT

DESCRIPTION
    This module replaces a special "# COPYRIGHT" comment in your Perl source
    files with a short notice appropriate to your declared copyright. The
    special comment must be placed before "__END__". Only the first such
    comment will be replaced.

    It is inspired by excellent Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prepender but gives
    control of the copyright notice placement instead of always adding it at
    the start of a file.

    I wrote this to let me put copyright statements at the end of my code to
    keep line numbers of code consistent between the generated distribution
    and the repository source. See Dist::Zilla::Plugin::OurPkgVersion for
    another useful plugin that preserves line numbering.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
    Code in this module is based heavily on
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::OurPkgVersion by Caleb Cushing and
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prepender by Jérôme Quelin. Thank you to both of
    them for their work and for releasing it as open source for reuse.
